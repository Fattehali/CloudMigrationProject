To begin with migration plan we are currently working on the IT landscape, we are dealing with monolithic ERP system which are characterized by the performance issue, scalability limitation, security risk and so on.

So our migration strategy is to perform either a refactoring or a rehosting

## Migration phases
### 1.	Planning and assessment
### Inventory of Resources:
Tools: Use Google Cloud Migrate for  all on-premises workload
Analyze current workloads with Google Cloud Migrate, including the SQL database cluster, mainframe, e-commerce apps, monolithic ERP, and 150 virtual machines.

VMs: Examine the 150 virtual machines (Windows Server and Linux) to record information about installed apps, CPU, memory, and storage usage, and OS versions.

Monolithic ERP System: Determine the database connections, system components, and particular dependencies (such as on other virtual machines or apps).

Determine the web servers, application servers, and backend connections that make up e-commerce applications.

SQL Database Cluster: Compile data on dependencies, transaction rates, schema, and database size.
